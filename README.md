# JavaGUI-GUI-Project

##  Project Overview  
This project involves the design, implementation, and testing of a Java-based TeacherGUI application. It focuses on class design, pseudocode, and thorough error detection covering syntax, semantics, and logical errors. The report includes detailed test cases and analysis.

## üìå Objectives  
- Understand object-oriented design through class diagrams  
- Write pseudocode and implement the TeacherGUI application  
- Identify and document common programming errors  
- Perform multiple tests to validate the program  
- Provide comprehensive project documentation  

## üóÇÔ∏è Contents  
- Introduction and project background  
- Tools used for development and documentation  
- Class diagrams illustrating program structure  
- Pseudocode and method descriptions  
- Testing results with error identification  
- Conclusion and references  


## üìö Key Learnings  
- Object-oriented design and implementation  
- Writing clear pseudocode for complex methods  
- Detecting and fixing syntax, semantic, and logical errors  
- Documenting test results and creating professional reports
